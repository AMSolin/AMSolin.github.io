# Data science portfolio by Alexander Solin

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms.

## Classification problems.

### Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. Many people started practicing in machine learning with this competition, so did I. This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
Titanic dataset provides interesting opportunities for feature engineering.

### Imbalanced classes

[Github](https://github.com/AMSolin/AMSolin.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Imbalanced.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AMSolin/AMSolin.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Imbalanced.ipynb)

In real world it is common to meet data in which some classes are more common and others are rarer. In case of a serious disbalance prediction rare classes could be difficult using standard classification methods. In this notebook I analyse such a situation. I can't share the data, used in this analysis.

### Churn prediction

[Github](https://github.com/AMSolin/AMSolin.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Churn.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AMSolin/AMSolin.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Churn.ipynb)

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. The companies are interested in identifying segments of these customers and their reasons, because the price for acquiring a new customer is usually higher than retaining the old one. In this notebook I analyse such a situation. I can't share the data, used in this analysis.
